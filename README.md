# spotify_stats_flask


## Description
### I built this so I could view my basic spotify account statistics.  

## features
### this application is made using flask and spotipy. It allows you to see your currently playing music on spotify, your most played songs and artists for intervals of 4 weeks, 6 months, and all time. 

### In the future I am going to allow users to see their saved artists and songs. Also I plan on creating a way for the user to rate songs and having an sql database to deal with rating information. Finally, I plan on eventually implementing oauth2 authentication so users do not need to use their account authentication tokens to access their account.
